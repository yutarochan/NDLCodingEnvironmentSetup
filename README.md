## Setting up Anaconda

### What is Anaconda
The Anaconda platform is used for package management, collaberative projects, and handling virtual environments. In Nittany Data Labs, we use Anaconda to handle all of the packages you have been using in your DataCamp courses. The packages you have been importing at the head of your programs, such as ```pandas``` and ```numpy```,  have to be installed on your computer before you can begin using them in all of the Data Science applications you write. When you install Anaconda on your system, you install of the packages and their necessary dependenciesn so when you begin writing full scale Machine Learning applications, you never have to worry about finding the package online yourself, Anaconda comes to the rescue.

#### Which Python do I have?
* For Mac OS or Linux, open Spotlight and search Terminal. Open Terminal and type ```which python```
    * If you do not have Python, download [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.3/python-3.6.3-macosx10.6.pkg)
* For Windows, run Command Prompt and type ```python```
    * If you do not have Python, download [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.3/python-3.6.3.exe)
   
#### Mac OS

* [Python 3.6 Anaconda Installer](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.0.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg)
* [Python 2.7 Anaconda Installer](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-5.0.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg)

#### Windows

* [Python 3.6 Anaconda Installer](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.0.0-Windows-x86_64.exe)
* [Python 2.7 Anaconda Installer](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-5.0.0-Windows-x86_64.exe)

#### Linux

* [Python 3.6 Anaconda Installer](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.0.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh)
* [Python 2.7 Anaconda Installer](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-5.0.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh)

#### Verify that Anaconda is Installed
* Run ```conda --version``` to verify that you have installed Anaconda correctly on your system
* Update Anaconda with ```conda update conda```
    * If a new conda version is available, ```Proceed ([y]/n)?``` type ```y```
* On your Terminal or Command Prompt, type ```python``` and now you are in a Python Shell, similar to the one you have been using on DataCamp!
    * type ```import pandas as pd``` and ```import numpy as np```
    * These might take a while (these packages are huge!)
    * Play around with them on your computer similar to how you do in DataCamp!

There you go, now you have access to all of the packages that you have been learning about on DataCamp! 

If you had any errors with the installation, or want to [learn more](https://anaconda.org/) about Anaconda, refer to this [Installation Guide](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html) for help, or contact you mentor.


## Setting up Sublime Text Editor

### What is Sublime Text
How do Data Scientists write their applications? They aren't using the DataCamp IPython Shell, they use Text Editors. Text Editors are applications that are used to develop code, manage configuration files, view databases and text files, or write your English Paper (although this may be difficult). Imagine how easy it is to write a paper in Microsoft Word. Text Editors make writing code easy for developers by giving them tools such as autocomplete, feature highlighting, and pretty color schemes. Here at Nittany Data Labs, we use Sublime Text as our Text Editor of choice. In the future, you may want to explore other Text Editors such as Atom, Vim, Notepad, etc. However, for now, we are going to stick with Sublime Text as our introductory Text Editor. Check out [this article](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/angular/MvPSE0Gy1rs) to see that it doesn't matter what Editor you use, look at the diversity within the Google Engineering community! As long as you get the job done, we do not care!

#### Downloading Sublime Text Editors
* [Mac OSX Sublime Installer](https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%203143.dmg)
* [Windows OSX Sublime Installer](https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%203143%20Setup.exe)
